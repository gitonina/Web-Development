# Web-Development
Projects for Web Development

## Tarea1
In this project, we just created static templates with static information, like register a person, but that information wont go anywhere. Its a beggining project, just for getting stated.

## Tarea2
This is where we started to see the real content of this course. We created databases for storing the people information. Also, we used a framework called Flask, that allows us to develop web content. It was a challenging project because it forces us to think beyond what we had seen before.

## Tarea3
This one is no different from tarea2 except the fuct that we had to use AJAX, for creating graphs and updating information
